# TiktokUploader
Autonous tiktok uploader outline.

This is just a sample of the code you would use to interact with the TikTok APIs and upload a video, you would need to integrate this with your application and make sure that you follow TikTok's terms and conditions, guidelines and restrictions.
As well it should be used with an user interface where user can select the video files, set the captions, hashtags, and other fields required for the upload process.

It's important to note that this is a basic example and there are many other things that you would need to take into consideration when creating a production-ready app such as error handling, user input validation, handling access token expiration, rate limiting, etc.



It's possible to create an automated TikTok uploader app using Node.js, but it would require quite a bit of work. Here's a rough outline of the steps you would need to take:

You would need to set up a TikTok developer account, and create a new app. Once you have done this, you will be given an API key, which you'll need to use to access TikTok's APIs.

Next, you would need to use a Node.js library or framework to interact with TikTok's APIs. There are a number of different options available, but one popular library is tiktok-scraper.

After that you will use TikTok's APIs to upload videos. To do this, you'll need to create an access token and then make an API call to upload the video. You will also need to provide information about the video, such as the caption and hashtags, as well as the video file itself.

Once the video is uploaded, you can use TikTok's APIs to get the video's metadata, such as the URL, and use it to share the video on other platforms.

You may want to include an user interface to your app, where user can select video files, setting the captions and hashtags, etc.

Keep in mind, you will have to follow TikTok's term and conditions, guidelines and restrictions that are currently on place for the use of their API. Furthermore, if you want to automate the upload process, you will have to use a scheduler or similar functionality to schedule the uploads on the desired date and time.

Creating an automated TikTok uploader app can be complex and requires a good understanding of TikTok's APIs and how they work, as well as a solid understanding of Node.js and JavaScript.
