// It's possible to create a TikTok uploader app using Flutter, but you would still need to interact with TikTok's APIs to upload the videos. Here's a rough outline of the steps you would need to take:

// You would need to set up a TikTok developer account, and create a new app. Once you have done this, you will be given an API key, which you'll need to use to access TikTok's APIs.

// Next, you would need to use a http library or package such as dio or http to interact with TikTok's APIs, using the access token obtained in the first step.

// Once you have the package installed, you can use it to perform requests to TikTok's endpoints. A common request is the one of /upload to upload a video, this request usually require a video file, a caption, and some other fields, these fields can be send as part of the request body,

var response = await Dio().post("https://api2.musical.ly/aweme/v1/upload/",
        data: FormData.fromMap({
          'video':  await MultipartFile.fromFile(videoPath),
          'caption': caption,
          'hashtags': hashtags,
          'access_token': access_token,
        }));
